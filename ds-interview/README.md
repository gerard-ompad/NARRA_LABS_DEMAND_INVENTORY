# Narra Labs Data Scientist Challenge

## Objective

NarraFood is a food delivery service that allows users to order meals from a wide variety of restaurants and have them delivered to their location.

The goal is to predict the total delivery duration of food orders placed on NarraFood. This involves analyzing the factors that influence delivery times and building a predictive model.

## Dataset

There is a provided dataset `orders.csv` that includes:

-   `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
-   `order_timestamp`: The timestamp when the order was placed (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)
-   `delivery_timestamp`: The timestamp when the order was delivered (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)
-   `distance_km`: The distance from the restaurant to the delivery location in kilometers
-   `order_size`: The number of items in the order
-   `restaurant_popularity`: A rating or score representing the restaurant's popularity (on a scale of 1 to 5)
-   `weather_conditions`: Describes the weather during the delivery (e.g., Clear, Rain, Cloudy, Fog)
-   `traffic_conditions`: A numerical indicator of traffic conditions (1 = Light, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Heavy)

## Expectations

We expect the data scientist to be able to do all of the following:

1.  **Data Preparation**

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

3.  **Feature Engineering**

4.  **Model Building**

5.  **Results Interpretation and Model Analysis**

6.  **Recommendations**


## Deliverables

-   A Python script containing the code to be able to predict total delivery times.
-   A one page report summarizing findings, visualizations, and recommendations.
